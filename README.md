# CS4485 Senior Design Project - Schedule Planner


We are planning to produce a more optimized schedule planner for UTD students for our project. We plan to develop a Web application with frontend and backend components. This software will be able to process and display a student's current and past coursework information to provide an easily readable measure of degree progress along with tools for planning future semesters. If this project needs to be changed or adjusted, please let us know so we may have a more correct plan on Friday.
